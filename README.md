# Slap City Slap Only
Removes every move from Ultra Fishbunjin 3000 except for jab (slap)
Also adds the clutch mechanic to it.

Enable/disable by editing `com.steven.slapcity.slaponly.cfg` in `BepInEx/config`

## Installation

If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST! Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Next, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/SlapCitySlapOnly/releases/latest) and place the dll in `BepInEx/plugins`

The mod is now installed!

### Dependencies
- SlapCityModdingUtilities (A mod I created that contains shared code for various mods)
- [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases/latest) (optional - makes it easier to enable/disable the plugin)
